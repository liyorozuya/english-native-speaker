In 2016, the British professional tennis player Andy Murray was ranked the world's number one.<u>==It was an  **<font color=#FF000>incredible achievement</font>** by any standard-made even more remarkable by the fact that he told this during a period considered to be one of the strongest in the sport's history, computing against the likes of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, **<font color=#FF000>to name just a few**</font>.==</u>Yet few years previously, he had been regarded as a **<font color=#FF000>talent outsider</font>** who entered but never won the major **<font color =#00800>tournaments</font>**.

**<font color=#FF000>Of the changes that account for this transformation</font>**, one was visiable and widely **<font color =#00800>publicised</font>**: in 2011, Murray invited former number one player Ivan Lendl onto his coaching team - a valuable addition that had a visiable impact on the player's playing style.Another change war so **<font color=#00800>subtle</font>** **<font color=#FF000>as to pass more or less unnoticed</font>**, Murray **<font color=#FF000>has long perferred</font>** a racket that consists of two types of string: one for the mains (**<font color=#00800>verticals</font>**)
